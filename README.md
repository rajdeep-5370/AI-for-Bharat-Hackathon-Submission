# JanSahayak AI: The Intelligent Scheme Information Hub 🇮🇳
### Bridging the gap between Government Policy and Citizen Reality

![Architecture Diagram](Architecture.jpeg)

## 🚨 The Problem
While the government releases thousands of beneficial schemes, the intended beneficiaries (Farmers, Students, Rural Citizens) often miss out due to:
**Information Overload:** Too many irrelevant schemes to sift through.
**Complexity Barrier:** Official documents use bureaucratic economic terms (e.g., "fiscal allocation") that are hard to understand.
**Lack of Context:** A generic search doesn't tell a farmer *how* a specific subsidy impacts their daily income.

## 💡 The Solution
**JanSahayak AI** is not just a chatbot; it is a **Context-Aware Information Router**.It filters the massive universe of government data based on who the user is (Identity-Aware) and translates complex policies into simple, relatable analogies (Complexity Reduction).

## ✨ Key Features
**🎭 Persona-Based Filtering:** Automatically detects if the user is a **Student** or **Farmer** and filters noise, showing only relevant schemes.
**🧠 RAG-Powered Explanations:** Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to fetch official guidelines and explain them in "plain English" or local languages.
**🗣️ Multilingual Support:** Accepts queries in Hindi/Regional languages and breaks down barriers.
**🔔 Proactive Notifications:** Alerts users about deadlines and new relevant updates before they even ask.
**👶 "Explain Like I'm 5":** A unique toggle to switch between detailed official text and simplified analogies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** Next.js (React)
**Backend & Database:** Supabase (Auth & PostgreSQL)
**AI Engine:** OpenAI / Claude API (LLM) + Supabase Vector Store (pgvector)


## 🚀 Future Roadmap
* Expansion to new personas: Women Entrepreneurs, Senior Citizens, and MSMEs.
* Voice-first interface for complete accessibility in rural areas.
* Integration with direct application portals (API-based form filling).
